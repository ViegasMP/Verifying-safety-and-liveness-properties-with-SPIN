# Verifying Safety and Liveness Properties with SPIN

This assignment consists of two model checking problems aiming to verify safety and live- ness properties using SPIN. Students shall learn how to model systems that have a challenging level of complexity, how to specify correctness properties and how to apply model checking in practice using SPIN. The assignment shall be carried out in groups of two students (groups of three students are accepted in exceptional circumstances). The first problem focuses on verifying a mutual exclusion protocol and the second problem consists in designing, modeling and verifying a solution to the dining philosophers problem.
